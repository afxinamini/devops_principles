# Devops Principles

## Pipelines

- Since there is just one branch with real clients and bussinees just care about that branch,
  you should make Production and Non-Production environments. from accesses to deployment platforms.
  In this way you are able to deploy any branches and not just `dev`, `stage`, and `master`.
